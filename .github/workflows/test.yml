  # A pull request sent from a fork of the upstream repository could be manipulated to do harmful things.
  # The upstream repositoryâ€™s maintainer would have no protection against this attack, as pull requests
  # can be sent by anyone who forks the repository on GitHub.
  # This is why we don't run automated tests on every PR.
